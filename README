### bactofidia: Basic microbial WGS analysis pipeline

**bactofidia** is a bacterial assembly and basic analysis pipeline using Snakemake and bioconda.


* Installation

A bioconda installation is required, see below if it is not installed on your system yet.
See the example script below for Linux 64-bit, for other options, see the [bioconda page](https://bioconda.github.io)

```bash
 wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
 chmod +x Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
 mkdir -p ~/tmp
 ./Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p ~/tmp/Miniconda2
 rm Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
 export PATH=~/tmp/Miniconda2/bin:$PATH 
 export PYTHONPATH=~/tmp/Miniconda2/pkgs/
 conda config --add channels conda-forge
 conda config --add channels defaults
 conda config --add channels r
 conda config --add channels bioconda
```
Consider to add the miniconda directory to your PATH environment variable by editing your ~/.bash_profile

Create a virtual environment for snakemake using python3:

```bash
 conda create -y -n snakemake python=3.5 snakemake
```


* Usage

Before running the pipeline for the first time, a virtual environment needs to be created. Packages and versions are specified in 'package-list.txt'. Adjust this file to your needs. See bioconda.github.io for available packages.

Then, create the environment with 

```bash
conda create --file package-list.txt -n [bactofidia_custom]
```
where [bactiofidia_custom] matches the name of the environment given in the config.yaml

The config.yaml file can be adjusted for parameters of the different tools.

For debugging or testing purposes, the pipeline itself can be dry-run with 

```
snakemake -np
```

The pipeline takes compressed sequencing files (.fastq.gz) which must be present in the same folder from where the script is called.
Use only the sample name to call the script.

Test the whole pipeline with:

`bactofidia.sh Test`

This will run the pipeline on the included Test.fastq.gz files.


Currently it runs:
 - quality check before and after trimming using seqtk
 - trimming with [seqtk](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/seqtk/README.html)
 - assembly with [spades](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/spades/README.html)
 - annotation with [prokka](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/prokka/README.html)
 - taxonomy determination with [kraken](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/kraken/README.html), vizualization with [krona](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/krona/README.html) 
 - mlst with [mlst](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/mlst/README.html)
 - quality assessment of assembly with [quast](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/quast/README.html)
 - resistance gene finding with [abricate](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/abricate/README.html)

Running only 

`bactofidia.sh`

will give an explanation of the (limited) options.
For further customizing, see [snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [bioconda] (http://bioconda.github.io/)
