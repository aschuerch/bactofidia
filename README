### bactofidia: Basic microbial WGS analysis pipeline    

**bactofidia** is a bacterial assembly pipeline using Snakemake and bioconda.
It is flexible and easily transferable

How to use:

Run the whole pipeline with:

`bactofidia.sh Test`

Running only 

`bactofidia.sh`

will give an explanation of the (limited) options.

Currently it runs:
 -quality check before and after trimming using seqtk
 -trimming with seqtk
 -assembly with spades
 -annotation with prokka
 -taxonomy determination with kraken, vizualization with krona
 -mlst with mlst
 -quality assessment of assembly with quast
 -resistance gene finding with abricate
 -assessing completeness and contamination of genome with checkm

When running the script it installs the bioconda package manager if necessary and creates a virtual environment with snakemake

The config.yml file of the pipeline can be adjusted for desired version of software. See bioconda.github.io for available packages.

For debugging or testing purposes, the pipeline itself can be dry-run with 

 `snakemake -np`


##need to adjust config.yaml and env.yaml

##env.yaml bactofidia but run checkm first time with checkm data setRoot etc (interactive prompt)....


conda env create -f env.yaml -n bactofidia_custom

make sure to 
checkm data setRoot
checkm data update
