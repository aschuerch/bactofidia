bactofidia is a bacterial assembly pipeline using Snakemake and bioconda.
It is flexible and easily transferable

Currently it runs:
 -quality check before and after trimming
 -trimming
 -assembly with spades
 -annotation with prokka
 -taxonomy determination with kraken, vizualization with krona
 -mlst
 -quality assessment of assembly with quast
 -resistance gene finding with abricate
 -assessing completeness and contamination of genome with checkm

When running the script bactofidia.sh it installs its own bioconda package manager and creates a virtual environment with snakemake

The config.yml file of the pipeline can be adjusted for desired version of software. 
See bioconda.github.io for available packages.

The pipeline itself can be dry-run with 

 snakemake -np --use-conda
